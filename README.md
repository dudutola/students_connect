# Students Connect: learn, teach, and grow together

A platform that helps students ask for support, share theirs skills, and learn from one another. It makes collaboration easy by connecting learners and tutors accross different topics.

## Motivation

During coding bootcamps or school projects, students often struggle alone or don't know who to ask for help. This platform solves that by connecting learners with other students who have the skills or availability to support them. The goal is to reduce frustration, encourage teamwork, and help everyone lean faster together.
